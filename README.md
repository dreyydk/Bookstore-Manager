# Bookstore Manager 📚

Bookstore Manager is an object-oriented JavaScript application that allows the user to interact and manage a database that contains information relevant to a bookstore, such as products (so far books and posters), stock, authors, users and orders.

## Features 📄

So far, the application has the follwing features:

- **Users creation and management.**
- **Authors creation and management.**
- **Books creation and management.**
- **Posters creation and management.**
- **Orders creation and management.**

Management options mainly include addition and removal functions, whether for the database or for the stock of a specific product.

To test the functionalities, a specific script was developed called "index.js", which when executed in a Node.js environment, should present the following output:

## How to test it ✅

Download the repository, and once complete, simply run "index.js" file in a Node.js environment.
